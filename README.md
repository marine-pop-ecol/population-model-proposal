# Population Model Proposal 

For this project, each group must submit a brief, 500 word proposal covering points 1-5 above. The purpose of this proposal is for the instructors to ensure you are on the right path, and to give you feedback on the model before you analyse it. The proposal should have:

- A brief paragraph on the species you selected, and itâ€™s life history. In this section, explicitly discuss the foundational papers on the species that you are using to describe the population and stage structure (2 points)
- The life cycle-graph denoting all relevant parameters symbolically (2 points)
- All equations for your model, and a corresponding table with parameter values and citations of where they are coming from. In cases where numerical values for parameters cannot be found, values can be chosen from closely related species or a rationale could be provided for the range of values that will be considered in your analysis (3 points)

Rubric:
| Section | Life History Paragraph | Life Cycle Graph | Model Equations |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | 
| Excellent (Full Marks) | All relevant information included. Primary literature supporting the three essential items: a)choices of variables, b) life stages, and c) parameters, are mentioned and referenced. | All stages are present, noting transitions, with transition arrows pointing the correct direction, and each arrow labeled with the corresponding parameter.The diagram is clear and easy to follow | All equations are present, and follow logically and accurately from the life cycle diagram. Parameter symmbols are logical, and all subscripts are accurate. All parameter values are listed clearly in a table, and are accurate to the papers referenced in the life history paragraph. | 
| Fair (Half Marks) | Most information included. One of a) the choice of variables, b) life stages, or c) the parameters were either not mentioned nor referenced. | Almost all important information was included with 1-2 minor mistakes. | There are 1-2 minor errors in the equations/parameter table. | 
| Poor (No Marks) | >1 of a) the choice of variables, b) life stages, or c) the parameters were either not mentioned nor referenced. | There were >2 incorrect components to the diagram. | There were >2 incorrect components to the equations or the parameter table. | 

## To Submit The Assignment

Together with your partner, write up the described proposal (above) in an RMarkdown document and subsequently knitting it to a pdf. Submit ONE version, via pushing to GitHub Classroom.
